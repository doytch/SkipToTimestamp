Adds clickable links via shortcode or search-and-replace that skip to a time in a media player.

== Description ==

Skip to Timestamp allows two ways of generating links in your posts that automatically skip to a given time
in an embedded media element. You've seen it in the Youtube descriptions, now get it in your embeds!

To create a link, either:

* Use our [skipto] shortcode which takes a "time" (or "timestamp" or "ts") argument and uses that to create a link.
Eg, "Just wait until...or...hold on, you can [skipto time=4:30]skip to[/skipto] this part of the video!"
* Check the "Replace Timestamps Automatically" checkbox in the Settings > Skip to Timestamp, and watch as all your
timestamps in the form "4:30" or "1:23:45" are automatically converted into links.

The links search for and skip to a time in:

* Youtube videos embedded using Wordpress embeds.
* HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; elements. Jetpack, Blubrry Powerpress and other plugins do this automatically using the [audio] shortcode.
* HTML5 &lt;video&gt; elements. Jetpack and other plugins do this automatically using the [video] shortcode.

== Installation ==

You don't really need to do anything special to install this plugin. Just:

1. Download using the button above, unzip and place the folder in your wp-content/plugins/ folder. Alternately,
install using Wordpress' built-in plugin installer.
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
1. Configure settings via Settings > Skip to Timestamp. Automatic timestamp replacement is turned off by default.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will this work with ____ player? =
If it adds an &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; tag, then maybe. The plugin uses the currentTime parameter of those elements
to set the location to skip to. If you open your browsers developer console and see a message saying
'Skip to Timestamp: No media player found!', then that player isn't currently supported. I'd like to help you
though, so please submit a request for that player on the Wordpress plugin page. It's the only way I know
which players to prioritise!

= Can I use both shortcodes and automatically-replaced timestamps? =
Yes, as long as you don't use both in the same post. Each post can contain either shortcodes OR timestamps to
auto-replace. If both are present, then timestamps will not be automatically replaced.

= It's not working! =
Please leave me a message with information about the media you embedded, how you tried to create the link, and what
browser and operating system you're running. If it's a bug, I'll get right to work on it!

== Screenshots ==
1. Timestamps in your posts can be automatically converted into links that jump to that time.
2. Control the text of the link by using our [skipto] shortcode.
